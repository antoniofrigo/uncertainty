# Uncertainty

A quick uncertainty propagator I whipped up in an afternoon. It's probably the only one that supports full LaTeX input and output. We use `math.js` to handle the AST parsing (it's a pain to do otherwise). Since mathjs doesn't handle LaTeX input very well, we escape them by replacing them with some unlikely string, take the partial derivatives with mathjs, and then reassemble the result.
